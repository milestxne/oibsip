OVERVIEW:

In my analysis, I employed clustering algorithms for segmentation analysis to evaluate customer data that encompassed various personal information. This approach allowed me to categorize customers into distinct groups based on shared characteristics and behaviors. By examining these segments, I was able to uncover valuable insights regarding customer preferences and trends. The findings highlighted specific patterns in purchasing behavior, enabling me to offer tailored recommendations aimed at enhancing customer engagement and improving marketing strategies.
