# YouTube Data Analysis and Preprocessing

## Project Overview
This project involves performing data analysis and preprocessing on a YouTube dataset. The primary goal was to clean, wrangle, and transform raw data into a format suitable for further analysis. The dataset consists of YouTube video statistics, including categories, views, likes, dislikes, and trending dates. The project focuses on handling missing data, standardizing columns, formatting data types, and identifying outliers using statistical methods.

## Key Steps in the Data Preprocessing

### 1. **Loading and Inspecting the Data**
   - Loaded the raw dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
   - Conducted an initial inspection of the dataset to understand the data structure and identify any issues related to missing data, incorrect data types, and inconsistencies.

### 2. **Data Type Wrangling and Formatting**
   - Investigated and analyzed the data types of the columns to ensure that each column had the appropriate type.
   - **Trending Date and Other DateTime Columns:**
     - Converted the **Trending Date** column and any other datetime-related columns into proper `datetime` format using Pandas' `to_datetime()` function.
     - Standardized the datetime format for consistency and usability in further analysis.
   - Ensured that all other columns, such as numeric variables, were in their correct format (e.g., `int`, `float`, `str`).

### 3. **Handling Missing Data**
   - Addressed missing entries within the dataset by filling **NaN** values with the string **"n/a"**. This was done for non-numeric columns where missing data could not be easily imputed with numerical values.
   - Provided a placeholder for missing categorical data to ensure the dataset remained complete and usable for analysis.

### 4. **Standardizing Column Names**
   - Renamed columns to follow a consistent naming convention (e.g., all lowercase with underscores between words).
   - This made it easier to work with the dataset in the later stages of the analysis.

### 5. **Identifying and Handling Outliers**
   - **Outlier Detection using IQR (Interquartile Range) Method:**
     - Focused on numerical columns such as `category_id`, `views`, `likes`, and `dislikes` to detect potential outliers.
     - Calculated the **Q1 (25th percentile)** and **Q3 (75th percentile)** for each numerical variable.
     - Computed the **IQR (Interquartile Range)** as the difference between Q3 and Q1.
     - Identified values outside the range of **[Q1 - 1.5 * IQR, Q3 + 1.5 * IQR]** as potential outliers.
     - Flagged and handled outliers by either removing or modifying values based on their impact on the dataset.

### 6. **Final Dataset Cleanup**
   - After handling missing data, formatting, and outlier detection, the final dataset was ready for analysis.
   - Ensured that the cleaned dataset was free from major inconsistencies and errors, providing a solid foundation for further analysis.

## Tools & Libraries Used
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and cleaning.


## Conclusion
This project provides a solid foundation for analyzing YouTube data by preprocessing and cleaning the dataset. The focus on handling missing data, wrangling data types, standardizing columns, and detecting outliers ensures that the dataset is in a structured and consistent format, ready for further analysis or machine learning.
